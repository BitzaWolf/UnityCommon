# Moving 3D Objects

Handy scripts for moving 3D objects around manually without using the Forces and physics system. Nice for simpler games or where you want really precise controls.

I suggest setting all 3D objects that use these scripts to have a rigidbody and set it to kinematic, which means the Unity engine knows it's not simulated by physics but it will still move around.
